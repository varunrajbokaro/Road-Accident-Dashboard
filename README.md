# Project Description

This project presents an interactive Road Accident Dashboard built in Excel using UK accident dataset. The solution provides insights into accident trends and key safety metrics across multiple dimensions.

# Structure of the Dashboard

The project is structured into four pages:
  * Home Page – Introduction and navigation.
  * Road Accident Dashboard – Visual representation of accident trends and KPIs.
  * Other KPIs – Additional analysis for deeper insights.
  * Data Used – Overview of dataset and fields utilized.

# Key KPIs and Insights

  * Types of casualties: Fatal, Serious, Slight
  * Casualties caused by different vehicle types
  * Casualties by road type (motorway, single carriageway, etc.)
  * Casualties by road surface condition
  * Casualties in rural vs. urban areas
  * Casualties under different light conditions
  * Year-on-year comparison of casualties
  * Casualties by district
  * Casualties by weekdays
  * Tools and Techniques
  * Excel for visualization and dashboard creation
  * Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
  * Pivot Tables for analysis and aggregation
  * Visual Charts (bar, line, pie etc.) for trends and comparisons
  * Slicers for interactive real-time filtering
